[Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a great way to host a personal website, and I started this one there this week. By creating a specially named repository, your webpage code can be hosted straight from Github. If Github, markdown, and code aren't old friends or at least intriguing acquaintances, a free website builder like [Weebly](https://www.weebly.com/) it probably a better fit for building your website.

I started by learning about [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/).
I initialized my repo with the theme and pulled a copy to my computer for customization.
My workflow is currently to make and commit changes locally then push them to Github; Github actions rebuilds and reloads the website and a minute later I check if my changes had the desired effect.
Soon after getting started, I stumbled on [Katerina Bosko's helpful series](https://www.cross-validated.com/Personal-Website-Mission-accomplished/) on setting up and customizing the Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme.
Katerina describes setting up a Docker container for development which would be handy, but isn't strictly necessary.
