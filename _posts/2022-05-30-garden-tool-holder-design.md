## Impetus

I needed some nice wall mounts to hang canoe paddles with the versatility to hold shovels, rakes, and other garden tools.

## Design details

All shafts were under 35 mm in diameter except one with a D-shaped handle.
The bore of the wall mount was designed to accommodate this with a 35 mm diameter.
The top of the wall mount was cupped to catch shovel blades and D-shaped handles.
An oblong cone shape was cut from the upper interior of the bore to securely cup the pear shaped handles common to flat water canoe paddle handles.
All design work was done in Tinkercad.
