The website name `ideaviation` or `idea-viation` or `idea-aviation` aims to capture a sense of the range of projects that might interest me: building a new app, a canoe, a 3D printable design, a garden redesign, or an original music composition.

Ideaviation is intended to invoke themes like:

- Ideas or ideation
- Aviation (and engineering)
- Deviation (which invokes statistics and free thinking)
- Variation (and statistics)
- Vita: latin for life

It is ambiguous and flexible enough of grow and mold to changing interests and times.
